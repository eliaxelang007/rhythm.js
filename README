# Soundtrack.js!

# Description
[soundtrack.js](https://github.com/eliaxelang007/soundtrack.js/tree/main) is a relatively thin wrapper around the Web AudioAPI that (hopefully) makes interacting with it a lot more intuitive!

The whole library is built around the concepts of Tracks and Compilation.

To play a track with soundtrack.js, use the following code!

```javascript
import { Player, Play } from "../dist/soundtrack.esm.js";

async function play() {
  const player = new Player(/* new AudioCommand() [You can optionally provide an AudioContext] */);
  const command = new Play("./celery_in_a_carrot_field.mp3");

  const audio_track = await player.load(command);

  audio_track.play();
}

play();
```

To clip a track, do this!

```javascript
import { Player, Play, Clip } from "../dist/soundtrack.esm.js";

async function play() {
  const player = new Player();

  const clip_start = 5;
  const clip_duration = 10;

  const command = new Clip(
    new Play("./celery_in_a_carrot_field.mp3"),
    clip_start,
    clip_duration
  );

  const audio_track = await command.compile();

  audio_track.play();
}

play();
```

`Clip` will start 5 seconds into its child node, `Play`, and then play the next 10 seconds.
To repeat a track, do this!

```javascript
import { Player, Play, Clip, Repeat } from "soundtrack.esm.js";

async function play() {
  const player = new Player();

  const clip_start = 5;
  const clip_duration = 10;

  const repeat_for = 20;

  const command = new Repeat(
    new Clip(
      new Play("./celery_in_a_carrot_field.mp3"),
      clip_start,
      clip_duration
    ),
    repeat_for
  );

  const audio_track = await command.compile();

  audio_track.play();
}

play();
```

The `Repeat` node will repeat the`Clip` inside of it for 20 seconds.

Play one command after another with `Sequence`!

```javascript
import { Player, Play, Clip, Repeat } from "soundtrack.esm.js";

async function play() {
  const player = new Player();

  const clip_start = 5;
  const clip_duration = 10;

  const repeat_for = 20;

  const command = new Sequence(
    [
      new Repeat(
        new Clip(
          new Play("./celery_in_a_carrot_field.mp3"),
          clip_start,
          clip_duration
        ),
        repeat_for
      ),

      new Clip(
        new Repeat(
          new Play("")
        )
      )
    ]
  );


  const audio_track = await command.compile();

  audio_track.play();
}

play();
```
